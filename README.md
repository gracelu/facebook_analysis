facebook_analysis
=================
Visualizations of my Facebook friend network made using Gephi. Clustering of friend groups is determined by running modularity over the network; separation of different clusters is determined by force atlas.

The two visualizations are from before and after my first year of college. The creation of a sizeable cluster from friends made at college is visably seen with the red cluster in the 2014 image. The clusters from high school friends remains similar even after one year. One interesting aspect of the second visualization is the emergence of "linkers" between clusters; these friends do not share many mutual friends but include a good number from my high school and college friends, making them key people in linking distinct clusters.

These visualizations provide not only insight into my Facebook friend network but also connections between my friends and the change of my network over time.
